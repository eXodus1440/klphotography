In this customer case study, we see two major players going head-to-head – the legendary Canon EOS-1D X Mark II and the new, fresh-faced Canon EOS R5. Karina Limburg, photographer and owner of a 1D X II, was curious to see how the two compared, so chose to hire the EOS R5 to find out. Being a wildlife photographer, decent autofocus is one of the most important features she needs to be able to rely on, so this was high on the list of priorities to be investigated! Read on for Karina’s findings having tested and compared both cameras. Karina has been kind enough to share some images with us – so you can decide the winner for yourself! Over to Karina:

My name is Karina and I am a keen animal and wildlife photographer – with a huge passion for big (and small) cats.  I primarily shoot on my DSLR bodies, the Canon EOS-1D X Mark II and Canon EOS-7D Mark II with either the Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS II USM or EF 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6L IS II USM lens. 

Some photography friends of mine have recently shared positive feedback and enthusiasm for Canon’s mirrorless range, so I wanted to compare the Canon R5 with my DSLRs on a real-life example – a Kingfisher workshop.

My main objective was to see how the autofocus would compare with the DSLR (I used the Canon EOS-1D X Mark II for the comparison) and whether there was any image distortion given I was using a Canon converter for the mirrorless R system. 

The feedback on Canon’s R5 is great; I was very impressed with the quality of pictures that came out having never used a mirrorless system before. While it was sometimes difficult for the autofocus to “find” my smaller subjects, a bit of zooming in and out did the trick and I am currently looking forward to the launch and testing of their professional range. 

This is the second time we have hired equipment through Hireacamera, both times were during lockdown, and both times have been fantastic. Chloe, Ellen and team made sure we had the right converters to match our equipment with the hire gear, and I would highly recommend them.

We think it’s an incredibly close call, what do you think? If you would like to try either, or perhaps both cameras and compare them for yourself, they are available via the links below:

A very big thank you to Karina for taking the time to write this report for us and for sharing these beautiful images, we think they would look absolutely breath-taking mounted on large canvases! You can find more of her amazing photography via the links below:
